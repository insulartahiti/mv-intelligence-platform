    "response": "Based on our graph and broader market context, these are the main categories of vendors that let banks modernize around/on top of legacy cores rather than rip-and-replace:\n\n### 1. “Meta-core” / Sidecar core platforms\nThese sit alongside the legacy core, handling new products and experiences while the old core continues to run deposits/GL, etc.\n\n- [10x Banking](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=28f0575d-ef9b-4b7f-b00c-f812f9854f90) – Markets SuperCore as a cloud-native “meta core” that can coexist with legacy mainframes. Typical pattern:\n  - Stand up 10x in parallel.\n  - Launch greenfield brands or new product lines on 10x.\n  - Gradually migrate books/products off the legacy core over time.\n- [Mambu](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=e3b1735f-3e8b-4d6e-a320-106a1b7c869b) – “Composable” core that is often used in coexistence mode:\n  - Use Mambu for specific products (e.g., SME lending, BNPL, digital-only brands).\n  - Keep main legacy core for the bulk of retail/commercial accounts initially.\n\nThese are used when a bank wants a phased migration path and optionality, not a big-bang replacement.\n\n### 2. Digital engagement / orchestration layers (modernize front and mid, keep legacy core)\nThese don’t replace the core; they abstract it and orchestrate journeys and products across channels.\n\n- [Backbase](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=a67a317d-ca97-2942-627d-5663ab760b97) – Digital engagement platform that:\n  - Sits on top of existing cores via APIs/ESB.\n  - Modernizes customer-facing UX (retail, SME, corporate) and employee portals.\n  - Allows banks to add new journeys and products without touching the underlying core schema every time.\n- Temenos Infinity–style stacks (represented in the graph via [Temenos](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=0dd30e76-0423-4386-86bf-061c17f1afb7)) can be used similarly: front‑end/digital/branch + orchestration on top of existing T24 or third‑party cores.\n\nThese are a fit when the bank’s main pain is digital experience and time-to-market, but the core is “good enough” for now.\n\n### 3. Cloud-native cores used as modular building blocks\nThese are full cores, but practically they’re often deployed incrementally, not as monolithic replacements.\n\n- [Aura Cloud](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=1ef0e4ed-c77a-496b-9867-c5c7cd0dc851) – Cloud‑native core focused on modular product building:\n  - Common pattern: use it for new digital subsidiaries/products.\n  - Over time, expand coverage; legacy core may remain for specific books.\n- Temenos Transact (via [Temenos](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=0dd30e76-0423-4386-86bf-061c17f1afb7)) – banks often run it in parallel initially (e.g., specific regions or products) while retaining an incumbent core elsewhere.\n\n### 4. Modern banking infrastructure platforms (more for fintech/banking-as-a-service)\nThese are more infra for fintechs or greenfield banks, but some incumbents use them to carve out modern stacks without touching the main core.\n\n- [Column N.A.](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=8e47fe4a-9840-41b6-bbd2-8176e4204b0d) – An API‑first bank using its own stack; incumbents might partner for specific embedded finance or payments flows rather than core replacement.\n\n---\n\nIf you share:\n- Target segment (tier-1 vs regional, retail vs commercial),\n- Geography,\n- Whether they want to launch new products vs refactor existing books,\n\nI can narrow this to a short, tailored vendor list and highlight which are most realistic for “modernization without core replacement” for that profile.",

[Bankingly](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=b293a605-4a04-9675-ca34-a459c6282c3c)  \n   - White‑label digital banking front‑end (web, mobile, conversational) for smaller banks, mainly in emerging markets.  \n   - More “digital channels as a service” than pure BaaS, but still enabling embedded digital banking experiences.\n\n9.
