    "intent": "Test semantic understanding of 'modernization' and 'core banking' concepts.",
    "success": true,
    "response": "Banks usually solve “modernize without full core replacement” via two broad patterns:\n\n1) **Digital / experience layers that sit on top of the core** (no or minimal changes to the core)\n2) **Progressive modernization / core‑adjacent platforms** (new product engines and services that coexist with the legacy core and gradually take over)\n\nBelow is a curated, *practically focused* list from your graph, grouped by how they’re used. I’ll emphasize those most aligned to “wrap, extend, or progressively modernize” vs “rip-and-replace”.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Digital + orchestration layers that wrap the legacy core\n\nThese players modernize channels, journeys, and product orchestration while leaving the existing core in place, often via APIs/middleware. They’re central to “progressive modernization” roadmaps.\n\n- [Backbase](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=a67a317d-ca97-2942-627d-5663ab760b97)  \n  - What it is: A digital banking engagement/orchestration platform across retail, SME, corporate, wealth.  \n  - How it’s used:  \n    - Sits as a **unified digital layer** on top of one or multiple legacy cores.  \n    - Modernizes UX (web/mobile), workflows, and product origination without forcing a core swap.  \n    - Often the first step in a multi‑year core-transformation roadmap.\n\n- [Bankingly](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=b293a605-4a04-9675-ca34-a459c6282c3c)  \n  - Cloud digital banking channels for smaller banks/co-ops.  \n  - Provides modern web/mobile experiences and some servicing capabilities while integrating to legacy cores.\n\n- [Plumery](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=5239e999-e09a-16da-b34c-787efac21938)  \n  - Composable digital banking experience platform.  \n  - Focus is fast, modern UX and orchestration on top of existing systems; can be a bridge into more modular architectures later.\n\n- [Prelim](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=fdccff9a-feba-4f66-a4d6-18d0f94b02f0)  \n  - No‑code digital onboarding / origination layer with integrations to KYC/KYB/AML vendors and bank systems.  \n  - Lets banks digitize front‑end workflows (esp. business banking) **without touching the core** initially.\n\n- [Agora](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=db83dcdf-3db8-42a6-a082-32850fe5dacf)  \n  - Modular, white‑label banking platform that can **decouple** customer‑facing and some product capabilities from the legacy core.  \n  - Particularly relevant where a bank wants new digital propositions (embedded/BaaS) while keeping existing core for the main book.\n\nThese are strongest when the bank’s near‑term goal is: “Modernize UX and launch new journeys fast, buy time to tackle the core later.”\n\n---\n\n## 2. Progressive / side‑by‑side core modernization platforms\n\nThese are full‑blown modern cores, but many banks adopt them in a **coexistence or ‘progressive migration’** model: new products, new segments, or greenfield entities go on the new stack while the old core runs off legacy portfolios.\n\n- [10x Banking](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=28f0575d-ef9b-4b7f-b00c-f812f9854f90)  \n  - Cloud‑native “meta core” (SuperCore).  \n  - Very commonly used in a **parallel‑core** strategy:  \n    - Bank retains old core for legacy book.  \n    - New products / new brands / new geographies go on 10x.  \n    - Over time, balances migrate—avoids big‑bang cutover.\n\n- [Thought Machine](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=54140ff0-4ea7-419c-9562-baf9fabe51c6)  \n  - Cloud‑native core (Vault).  \n  - Frequently deployed as a **new-core next to legacy**, with coexistence via integration/middleware.  \n  - Supports progressive migration and product‑by‑product cutover.\n\n- [nCino](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=ee9fd540-e547-4eb4-bba6-acd8f94f465c)  \n  - Cloud banking platform (origination + some core processes) often layered over existing cores.  \n  - Particularly strong in **lending transformation**—you can digitize and partially “re‑core” lending without touching deposits or cards.\n\n- [Aura Cloud](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=1ef0e4ed-c77a-496b-9867-c5c7cd0dc851)  \n  - Cloud core for accounts, lending, payments.  \n  - Can be run as a **new engine for specific products** (e.g., SME lending, new digital bank sub‑brand) with legacy core still in place.\n\n- [Engine by Starling](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=8b073d3f-4267-4941-ad56-40a19535afc9)  \n  - SaaS digital banking platform proven within Starling.  \n  - Similar pattern: launch new digital propositions on Engine while existing bank franchises remain on legacy systems.\n\n- [Temenos](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=0dd30e76-0423-4386-86bf-061c17f1afb7) and [Avaloq](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=007f15bc-0425-4025-83d3-94812e4e75e8)  \n  - Both can be deployed in **phased or coexistence models**: e.g., start with certain product lines or regions, or run greenfield entities, then progressively migrate.\n\nHere the key is architectural: an integration/middleware layer that allows the old and new cores to coexist and share data, avoiding a single “big bang” conversion.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Tools for *safely changing legacy cores* rather than replacing them\n\nThese are more niche but very on‑point for “improve / modernize what we have without ripping it out.”\n\n- [Tweezr](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=44efd00c-95f6-49ae-ac61-289bfd911c53)  \n  - AI‑powered tooling to modify COBOL‑based and other legacy financial systems **incrementally**.  \n  - Value prop: precise refactors, new features, and risk reduction **inside** the legacy core, shortening timelines for modernization and reducing the need for wholesale replacement.\n\n- [ARCAD Software](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=ef24e52b-ec7f-40ad-3577-d1799dc21878)  \n  - DevOps + application modernization, strong on IBM i and other legacy environments.  \n  - Enables CI/CD, refactoring, and gradual modernization of core systems and surrounding applications.\n\nThese matter when the bank has decided “we’re not replacing the core in the next 5–10 years” but wants to make it more agile and governable.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Embedded / BaaS platforms that route *around* the old core\n\nLess about modernizing the incumbent core and more about standing up **new digital propositions in parallel**, sometimes using separate partner banks.\n\n- [CLOWD9](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=64c6c470-a083-4dc2-bd8a-b4fa91b9a4ee) – issuer processing platform.  \n- [CloudCard](/knowledge-graph?nodeId=0651e35b-0839-a8ee-cec1-30755056dce8) – digital banking & card issuance.  \n\nBanks sometimes use these to launch card / wallet / embedded propositions off‑core while slowly refactoring core capabilities.\n\n---\n\n## How to narrow this for a specific bank situation\n\nIf you share:\n- Region / regulatory regime,\n- Primary pain point (e.g., deposits core vs lending vs corporate banking),\n- Appetite for change (5‑year coexistence vs near‑term full replacement),\n\nI can:\n- Prioritize 4–6 most relevant vendors from this list,\n- Sketch a reference architecture (what sits where relative to the legacy core),\n- Map typical “phase 1 / phase 2 / phase 3” milestones for a progressive‑modernization program.",
